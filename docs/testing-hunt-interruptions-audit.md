# Hunt interruptions: failure inventory before implementation

Native scenarios must expose these failures before corresponding units can be removed:

- An armadillo quest suppresses configured passing Goo attacks outbound, or retaliation replaces the Hunt destination. Passing attacks on the return leg must also happen without losing Daisy ownership or its reward.
- A merchant rendezvous takes ownership of a travelling fighter and never releases the party; collection duplicates or loses inventory; resumed travel changes the quest or destination.
- Merchant death while a queued or active job owns work loses durable intent, retries an already-completed transfer, or blocks the Hunt indefinitely.
- Fighter death leaves a stale Hunt/combat owner, prevents native respawn, or permits the same failed mission to continue despite blacklist policy.
- Coordinator restart while merchant collection is interrupting travel loses the continuation or replays the item transfer.

Setup may seed initial quest/inventory or introduce native monsters at a controlled encounter point. Monsters must die from native attacks, inventory must move through native socket handlers, and Daisy must award the token. No fabricated heartbeat, arrival, acknowledgement, HP decrement or reward assignment is permitted. Root runs the shared game stack serially. New cases remain **unverified** until its native run passes.

The inventory below distinguishes race/negative variants from ordinary scenarios. A passing normal journey cannot justify deleting delayed acknowledgements, changed generations, deadline boundaries, or unrelated event ownership variants. Remove a unit case only after matching native evidence is available.

## Scenario contracts and audit inventory

- **HC-PASS**: armadillo quest; identified native Goo attack and death outbound and returning; exactly one real Daisy token for each seeded quest owner.
- **HC-STOP**: configured stop-required Goo; observe the identified encounter committed by a defending convoy, toggle passing back on without abandoning the fight, then native kill, original armadillo cycle/target preserved and Daisy reward. The newly introduced Goo starts at five seconds of the fighters' actual server attack × frequency, recorded in the artifact, so the stopped interval remains observable under either fixture loadout; native combat alone removes that HP.
- **MH-DEATH**: leader dies during Goo Hunt; native respawn; eligible follower armadillo quest takes ownership and yields its token.
- **MH-COLLECT**: real marked seven-leather collection during owned outbound Hunt; coordinator restart, queued merchant death and active interrupted-job death variants; preserved Hunt cycle, conserved inventory/bank, cleared durable job, exactly one native Hunt reward for each owner and restart.

**MH-DEATH passed against the native server**: one leader death, native respawn, Goo blacklist, follower armadillo ownership and actual Daisy reward. **All three MH-COLLECT variants passed** in the fresh native run: coordinator restart (1.8 minutes), queued merchant death (3.0 minutes), and active merchant death. Removed two expanded unit cases now replaced by that evidence: the ordinary monster-hunt collection variant and persisted merchant-interruption restart. Subsequent HC-PASS, HC-STOP, cold-defense and ordinary Town recovery native runs also passed; final combined-run results remain separate from these focused proofs. Each source declaration is listed; loop expressions identify expanded families instead of pretending one declaration equals one runtime case. Candidates remain until the matching native case passes, and each extra negative/ordering branch still needs its own proof.

The separate recovery suite injects one follower completion-request loss, one completion-response loss, and a follower reconnect. Only the transient completion-network branch overlaps directly with its first two cases. It does not inject sustained report loss, clock skew, reordering, repeated reconnects, or mismatched ownership identities.

The first travel-combat run exposed a test precondition mistake: public coordinator phase is `travel`, whereas `shared-travel` describes a client command. It timed out before introducing either controlled Goo, so that failure is not evidence of a program combat bug. The corrected return precondition also requires actual native walking outside a Town cast; attacking is intentionally suppressed during map transitions. Controlled encounters carry an `e2eHunt` marker solely for between-test cleanup.

The merchant restart scenario caught a **program bug**: manual `/bank-party` requests create `party collection` jobs, but item handoff filtering recognized only legacy `marked items` and `inventory cleanout` names. Native logs showed both party visits succeeding and transferring gold, while the seven authorized leather remained on the warrior and the queue was empty. The maintained fix shares collection recognition across dispatch, handoff and live pickup revalidation. All three native merchant interruption variants subsequently passed with the maintained fix; this is not evidence that restart itself discarded a job. Exact cargo conservation is stable because the pinned server's armadillo, Goo, Mainland and global loot tables do not award leather.

Inventory: 24 owned suites, 282 source declarations (expanded runtime cases are not counted here). Unrelated event/UI/healing/commerce variants are explicitly retained with their narrower missing boundary.

## Crosscut movement audit

These seven suites were reviewed separately from the interruption scenarios. Each row remains retained unless the root native run supplies the **same fault and outcome**, including every listed loop variant. Table titles are source declarations, not an inflated runtime-test count.

### convoy-communication.test.cjs

Real network loss can replace only the matching loss/recovery path. Keep stale identity matrices, hours-long budget preservation, flapping cooldown, partial arrival, repeated runtime replacement, permanent HTTP errors and legacy saved failures until those conditions are injected. A successful merchant restart does not prove them.

### convoy.test.cjs

The native Hunt journeys execute real search, travel, return and combat handoff. Keep exact cruise restoration ownership, synchronized departure boundaries, stale response races, blocked geometry, interrupted Town, suspended scheduler and no-movement-during-planning checks until observed under those specific faults.

### convoy-timing.test.cjs

Keep offset and monotonic clock tests, reordered full/fast reports, mismatched leases, disconnected samplers and transporting holds. Normal network recovery is not evidence for clock jumps or response reordering.

### convoy-restart-recovery.test.cjs

### shared-convoy.test.cjs

Keep geometry mismatches, runtime/version/identity matrices, exact arrival boundaries, repeated retry exhaustion, route publication validation and delayed responses. A native reward after network recovery covers only the injected receipt-loss path, not all protocol errors. Native passing Goo covers a real encounter but does not inject reordered retaliation reports or a follower-only attack.

## Native stop-required loot regression

HC-STOP failed after the actual controlled Goo death: both native quests stayed at armadillo count 1, the convoy completed its leader loot pass and resumed, but the rare encounter stayed in `Collecting goo drops`. The leader retained the previous rare receipt while the follower had the current one. After the party left the kill location, a second location-scoped leader rare receipt could never complete. This is a product ownership bug, not a timeout or fixture correction.

The fix captures the owning convoy epoch alongside its ID. Rare completion can consume that exact leader convoy receipt only after the encounter death and barrier creation, with matching realm/map/instance. Previous epochs, other convoys, follower receipts, incomplete receipts, and pre-death passes remain invalid. Standalone rare identity checks remain unchanged. No stale receipt is synthesized and no assertion is relaxed. The repeatable native regression HC-STOP passed as case 31 of the full native run. Minimized authentic evidence: [testing-hunt-stop-loot-red.json](testing-hunt-stop-loot-red.json).

Native merchant replacement evidence is archived in `.build/hunt-fixes-red-e2e-results/live-hunt-merchant-native--86763-losing-or-duplicating-cargo-live/trace.zip` (restart) and `.build/hunt-fixes-red-e2e-results/live-hunt-merchant-native--5e224-losing-or-duplicating-cargo-live/trace.zip` (queued death). Active death also passed: `.build/hunt-fixes-red-e2e-results/live-hunt-merchant-native--f1079-losing-or-duplicating-cargo-live/trace.zip`. The nine-case run finished with seven passes and two failures (HC-STOP and anniversary); all 302 archived file hashes were verified. The report is `.build/hunt-fixes-red-e2e-report/`. Each includes `hunt-merchant-owned-before-fault` and `hunt-merchant-recovered-and-rewarded` attachments. This audit removes two expanded runtime unit cases (one whole declaration and one loop member); HC-STOP subsequently passed as case 31 in the full native run. Its exact monster-hunt loop member is now removed; party-travel and negative ownership/ordering cases remain.

## Partial Town return: failure inventory and native regressions

Before implementation, failure modes identified: one actual Town cast fails while peers arrive; walking-only planning still emits a forbidden Town edge; a legitimate obstacle detour increases straight-line distance and falsely exhausts the thirty-second progress timer; runtime replacement or coordinator restart loses the return owner; stale positions, old commands or replaced runtimes falsely refresh progress; a moving loop bypasses the absolute deadline; restricted-map avoidance wrongly blocks an explicit endpoint.

`live-hunt-town-recovery.spec.ts` was written before the planner/recovery fixes. Its ordinary and coordinator-restart variants cancel one actual native Town cast, observe the split party, require walking recovery and original native Daisy rewards. The ordinary native variant passed with 31.1 seconds of real movement without getting closer to Town. The initial restart variant also earned both rewards but correctly re-enabled Town after native readiness recovered; its original permanent-walking assertion exceeded the product contract. Both final Town cases passed in `.build/town-final-e2e-report/` (133 artifact files verified). The restart case requires actual initial walking; any subsequent native Town request must follow an explicit coordinator eligibility transition, and both original quest owners must receive their rewards. The adapter now biases Town-disabled requests toward walking and rejects residual Town edges because upstream alpathfinder exposes no Town-disable option. Default legal shortcuts remain unchanged. Rendezvous progress recognizes fresh displacement only under the current command/epoch/navigation/runtime owner; thirty-second no-progress and 120-second absolute bounds remain. Existing 107 planner/return/shared-convoy checks pass; no new isolated tests were written and no live runtime was activated.

## Cold defending command regression

Native goldenbat and cutebee cases failed when Hunt preparation was replaced with defense between leader heartbeats. The leader acknowledged the defense command without ever installing a local convoy handle; its combat stayed blocked while the follower waited for its target. The fix reuses normal convoy ownership initialization for a complete authorized cold defense packet, then installs the ordinary stopped defense state before acknowledgement. Current navigation revision, runtime, convoy identity, packet shape, membership and protected movement checks remain required. The existing native failures preceded the fix; no new unit was written. After the exact replaced unit removal, 108 travel-defense/shared-convoy checks passed. The deterministic native cold-defense case passed: genuine prepare responses were lost, the leader had no local handle, and the next real defense command led to native damage, death, gem loot and both original Hunt rewards. Minimized evidence: [testing-cold-defense-red.json](testing-cold-defense-red.json).

Verified removal count for this interruption audit is now **four expanded unit cases**: two merchant collection/restart cases, the HC-STOP monster-hunt member, and the network-error completion acknowledgement retry member. No stale-observation, cancellation, ownership, deadline or unrelated-purpose matrix was removed. Historical fixed HC-STOP evidence is archived in `.build/hunt-full60-diagnostic-e2e-results/`; final combined-run evidence remains separate.

## Native death fault publication

The full native run exposed an incomplete fault fixture in queued merchant death: direct server `rip(player)` left the stationary merchant at server HP 0 while its client still reported full HP and never attempted respawn. Upstream `rip` does not publish the player update itself. The first publication fix introduced a tagged lethal Goo through native `commence_attack`; the final helper uses a temporary Rime Djinn and native non-stacking `rimeshatter` so only the intended character dies. It requires real damage and dead-player receipts, removes only the injected attacker with respawning disabled, and leaves character recovery to production code. All six final helper consumers passed natively: fragile-character respawn, fighter death during Hunt, death thresholds one and two, queued merchant death and active merchant death. These fixture corrections are not claimed as product bug fixes. The earlier merchant pass did not expose this stationary publication gap. Existing focused checks after the defense revision guard: 108 passed.

## Rare fixture population isolation

A later combined run reached native Goldenbat death and gem loot, returned Hunt to farming, then found no eligible Goos for 90 seconds. Client diagnostics show no movement owner or departure hold. The cold-defense setup had used `spawnRare(goo)`, which held global species `respawn=-1` until scenario cleanup. Pinned upstream `remove_monster` skips respawn queue insertion under that definition; restoring it later cannot recreate omitted entries. This is fixture contamination, not proof of a failed Hunt handback. Minimized evidence and its limits: [testing-native-population-red.json](testing-native-population-red.json).

Setup now installs a temporary species definition only inside the synchronous native constructor call and restores the exact original object in `finally`, including when creation fails. It never overrides respawn. Native `new_monster` copies initial HP, max HP, attack, speed, range and aggro into the instance; its existing `temp:1` already suppresses that instance's respawn. Later native stat recalculation uses the normal species definition, except the controlled Cute Bee receives per-instance `zone_stats` with avoidance set to zero. Its natural 99.9% avoidance remains an explicit coverage gap; actual attacks, death and loot remain native. The legacy reset restoration guard remains for previously interrupted fixture versions; it is not the normal restoration path. The final seven rare cases passed against the corrected fixture and a fresh isolated server: six native rare kill/loot/Hunt-handback workflows plus disabled-rule/preferences behavior. Evidence is archived in `.build/rare-final-e2e-report/` (267 artifact files verified). The later 54-case diagnostic and its two failures are recorded below; the two Town cases are a separate verified partition. No live server was changed.

The ordinary passing-Goo and deliberate death helpers also use native constructor `temp:1`. A spawn-definition `respawn` field is ineffective here: upstream removal reads the global species interval. Temporary instances avoid latent respawn entries while ordinary removal still decrements native population counters; the lethal helper no longer uses `nospawn`, which would skip those decrements.

The completed 54-case diagnostic passed 52 cases, including cold-defense, armadillo combat, all merchant interruptions and both completion-network faults. Its 1,475 evidence files remain intact in `.build/remaining54-diagnostic-e2e-{report,results}/`; the manifest correctly remains failed. The two failures were unintended stacked collateral damage in the death-threshold fixture and a real follower rendezvous lease mismatch. Native Rime Shatter now isolates the intended death while requiring unchanged peer HP and actual damage/death receipts; [the minimized fixture evidence](testing-single-death-red.json) records why Hunt's count of two was correct. The maintained local convoy now publishes its route version before rendezvous; [the native reconnect failure](testing-follower-lease-red.json) records fresh transport trapped in repeated holds. The reconnect correction subsequently passed its dedicated native run, archived as `.build/reconnect-final-e2e-{report,results}/` with 100 file hashes verified. The local route version is initialized before the awaited rendezvous so current fast-response leases renew correctly. No live server was changed.

## Latest recovery verification

The `.build/recovery11-diagnostic-e2e-{report,results}/` run passed **10 of 11** native cases; 380 artifact file hashes were verified. All six single-character death consumers and both completion-network fault cases passed. The remaining Town-restart case reached a long real rendezvous but incurred an incorrect preparation retry after approximately 61 seconds: the preparation clock included prior rendezvous time. A maintained production clock correction has been applied; its final three-case native rerun passed **3 of 3** in `.build/return-clock-final-e2e-{report,results}/`, with 163 artifact files verified. Both Town variants and follower reconnect completed without an extra Town preparation retry, and both native quest owners received their actual rewards. The previous `town-final` two-case pass remains historical evidence; the `return-clock-final` run validates the later clock correction.

The dedicated `reconnect-final` run passed **1 of 1** with 100 file hashes verified. The latest retained suite passed **3,166 tests** under the strict TAP gate, and lint passed. Artifact integrity counts establish archive completeness; they do not turn a diagnostic run with a failure into a green run.

Final aggregate verification contains **63 unique E2E cases whose latest outcomes passed**, across six preserved runs and their captured source snapshots. This is not a claim that one complete final suite ran against one final snapshot. The final return-clock archive specifically verifies the latest preparation-clock correction; earlier diagnostic failures and their artifacts remain preserved.
