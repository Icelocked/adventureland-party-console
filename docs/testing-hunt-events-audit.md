# Hunt anniversary and rare-event audit

Failure modes recorded before implementation: interruption must retain Hunt identity, native rewards must not duplicate across restart, disabled events must not acquire movement, Hunt off must not revive on return, manual navigation must supersede rare return, dead or rejected evidence must not reopen pursuit, and loot must complete before departure. Scenario setup may control initial native encounter difficulty and scheduling; observations, actions and rewards remain native.

No file is approved for deletion until its mapped native scenario passes. Unmapped cases remain explicit coverage gaps; a broad happy path does not replace a guard matrix.

## Native scenario mapping (anniversary, rare and Franky journeys verified)

| Native journey | Existing cases it can replace only after passing | Explicit gaps |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Anniversary visit resume/restart/Hunt-off | Successful kiss reward; completed claim survives restart; current Hunt resumes; Hunt off stays off | Exact 60/90-second boundary, pending skill cancellation, missing target retries, late permission fences |
| Anniversary disabled while Hunt kills | Disabled raw anniversary cannot preempt Hunt or reward an unselected visitor | Enabled combat event outranking anniversary and protected Daisy claim gap |
| Six native rare species killed, chest opened, same Hunt resumed | Per-species death/loot continuation, optional field-generator off, unchanged Hunt cycle/mission | Claimed outsider, stale/foreign-instance sighting, missing heartbeat, protected navigation |
| Disabled rare and malformed settings | Disabled rare cannot acquire; real HTTP validation preserves settings | Phoenix patrol independence and route geometry |
| Existing real Goobrawl restart/Hunt-off journeys | Basic event evacuation restart and Hunt-off behavior | Deferred/offline late member, stale generation, unrelated convoy and failed-child ownership matrices |
| Existing restored Franky historical recovery | Acknowledged exit after cross-map progress resumes current Hunt | Every other historical recovery corruption/ownership state remains unproven |

Anniversary commerce, BankBoi supply routing, reciprocal slice identity and UI/time-format cases are not Hunt execution tests. They remain outside this migration unless a dedicated native economics/UI journey replaces their outcomes. Phoenix scan geometry and durable rejection evidence are algorithmic failure boundaries; no kill happy path justifies deleting them.

## Native scheduling limitation found in the first smoke run

The upstream anniversary rule factory uses fixed half-hour slots and has no public force-start hook. The disposable scenario advances only its supplied clock to a round boundary. Native ticket eligibility, kiss validation, delivery, and gift counts all succeeded (fighter one gift, featured character two, merchant one). The coordinator retains the emitted future round deadline after the native event is switched off, so this setup cannot claim coverage of natural wall-clock expiry. The planned completion action is explicit real event deselection, with the return assertion scoped to that user action. Natural timed expiry and early global deactivation remain separate uncovered behaviors.

## Retained failure boundaries (reviewed by domain)

The case list below includes parameterized declarations; interpolated words represent the declaration's full input matrix, not a single native scenario. All listed cases remain retained until a native scenario reproduces their particular failure trigger and assertion. Specifically:

- `hunt-event-handoff`, `hunt-event-priority`, and `hunt-event-resume`: ordinary success does not exercise late permission responses, event/non-event death attribution, stale generations, missing party members, failed-child ownership, or changed navigation revisions. The two Franky journeys replace only their directly demonstrated recovery states.
- `hunt-temporary-encounter` and `encounter-recovery`: nearby rare kills do not establish disappearance timers, stale observation pauses, delayed convoy receipts, external claims, or legacy destination migration. Those timing and ownership tests stay.
- `anniversary-kiss`, `anniversary-staging`, `anniversary-return`, and merchant reservation tests: real rewards and explicit deselection do not establish natural scheduling boundaries, unresolved skill promises, absent featured targets, retry limits, or later-round claim identity. Keep these fault cases even after the reward scenarios pass.
- `rare-hunting`, `rare-hunting-client`, `passive-rare-queue`, and `rare-farming-return`: species kill-and-loot scenarios cover actual attack/loot/continuation, but not foreign realms/instances, third-party claims, Fairy generator deployment, offline followers, missing heartbeats, or superseding navigation. Retain those independent guards.
- `rare-retry-evidence` and `phoenix-patrol-regression`: none of the seeded nearby encounters traverses the five-region patrol, exhausts pursuit budgets, or replays rejected evidence across restart. All of those cases remain meaningful independent coverage.
- `event-selections`, `rare-hunting-settings`, and UI tests: native HTTP rejection covers the explicitly sent malformed settings only. Dropdown interaction, inherited settings, catalog sorting, and unsupported choices require their own browser assertion before deletion.

## Native loot evidence

Rare encounter setup supplies the upstream monster's supported `drops` field with a guaranteed `gem0` drop. This is an explicit initial encounter fixture, alongside reduced encounter difficulty. The native server still owns damage, death, drop creation, chest opening, distribution, and inventory writes. Each scenario requires both an actual `chest_opened` socket receipt containing the gem and an authoritative party inventory increase; XP alone is not treated as loot proof. Natural rare-drop probabilities are outside this fixture's claim.

## Additional cross-cutting Hunt audit

Reviewed the complete test bodies in the following files, including cases whose title does not say Hunt. Existing green Goobrawl and Franky journeys do not justify deleting tests for different persisted states or invalid ownership evidence.

### completed-return-cleanup.test.cjs

- **Return completion releases its running convoy and matching commands:** candidate for replacement by a green anniversary resume scenario that proves actual post-return quest kills. The native scenario must establish movement release, not only a changed stage. Awaiting that green result.
- **Completed convoy restored as failed at Daisy:** retain; the new anniversary restart happens after the kiss, not with this explicitly completed/failed convoy mismatch.
- **Preserve newer convoy/commands:** retain; no event E2E injects superseding ownership during cleanup.
- **Gigacrab return inside an area away from center:** retain; native Goobrawl/Franky does not prove this boundary-vs-center arrival contract.
- **Reject stale/dead/wrong-instance/outside-area arrival matrix:** retain; each input can independently admit an invalid completion.
- **Point-only proximity:** retain; prevents accidentally applying broad area acceptance to point destinations.

### farming-navigation.test.cjs

All cases remain retained. Native anniversary completion does not trigger the specific failures below:

- Focus-clear leader/follower/solo isolation, clear-before-Town and Town-before-clear, repeated empty focus persistence, and Town preserving monster selections: explicit manual cancellation revisions are absent from the native event journeys.
- Merchant missing target, timeout/unreachable target, first-attempt refusal, stale round/target/member/revision/failure-kind rejection, and duplicate abort: native successful kiss and user deselection do not emit these failed operation receipts.
- Cancelled/offline waypoint preservation, serialized abort suppressing staging, featured-member abort with competing combat handoff, and late merchant failure during an existing return: concurrent ownership/receipt races remain uncovered.
- Stale staging/return-ready after cancellation and current staging with no waypoint: protect against restoring client-reported obsolete coordinates.
- Genuine cross-map cave return, already-arrived no-convoy return, distinct per-member waypoints, one-member cancellation during flight: new native scenarios exercise a shared Goo Hunt only, not these topologies.
- Cancelled/superseded returns, lost return using its original destination, offline return invalidation, failed convoy bounded retry, and persisted individual-reunion deadlock: each creates a separate historical failure state not introduced by successful Goobrawl/Franky completion.
- Stale individual completion versus newer command/deferred return: an actual reordered receipt has not been tested.
- Previous-round buffs, exact one-minute featured hold, and completed visits waiting through temporary competing movement: the seeded native anniversary clock deliberately does not claim these timing contracts.
- Dead/wrong-instance arrival and offline-before-initial-dispatch durable waypoint: keep negative observations until native fault injection exercises them.
- Legacy empty-backup cancellation across anniversary then Goobrawl, with manual Town still blocking: retain; existing native event cycles start with current settings and do not reproduce the legacy cancellation reason.

### hunt-ab-return.test.cjs

- Protected Daisy travel when A/B ends: retain; no native A/B event journey exists yet.
- Already-stranded A/B return, with and without restart: retain; the Franky historical fixture does not contain this owner-lost Daisy convoy or preserve its exhausted return retry counter.
- Handoff blockers (stale, inside, dead, cancelled, revision, command, other convoy, escape, death recovery, other failure, old cycle, Town running): retain the entire parameter matrix; these are separate ownership and freshness guards.
- Delayed A/B completion and duplicate ended requests: retain; native event completion success does not replay obsolete receipts.

### coordinator-recovery-hooks.test.cjs

- Supplied saved-Hunt reset and optional quest preparation: retain; distinguishes the supplied suspended object from the currently active Hunt and exercises claim/return ownership phases.
- Tiny P repeatedly attempting to preempt a protected Daisy return: retain; new rare encounters are introduced during farming, not during protected turn-in.
- Escape cancellation observing participants after convoy cancellation: retain; tests a mutation ordering hazard and preserving unrelated merchant commands, absent from event journeys.
- Failed recovery convoy result propagation: retain; no native route admission rejection is introduced by anniversary success.

### coordinator-navigation-actions.test.cjs

- Franky exit acknowledgement allocates Town once, accepts exact replay, and rejects an older convoy: retain. The green Franky party case proves deselection admits all participants, while the historical recovery begins after Town; neither replays native exit-completion packets.

### coordinator-status-composition.test.cjs

- Rare ownership keeps fighter and merchant heartbeats grouped before restoring Hunt scatter: retain; the new native rare scenarios start with Goo and do not assert scatter-mode suppression/restoration under a merchant heartbeat.
- Market authentication/hour boundary and inherited registry-name rejection: outside Hunt coverage; retain their separate security/scheduling assertions.

### coordinator-state-factory.test.cjs

- Persisted Hunt trips and combat-handoff records: retain pending native restart assertions for those historical records specifically. The existing restart checks prove Hunt progress, not preservation of accounting history.
- Lucky-slot defaults, explicit slot zero, and old hardcoded-slot migration: outside Hunt execution; retain until economics E2Es assert those settings migrations.

## Native pre-start deselection regression

The latest native deselection run exposed a production guard defect: the coordinator had recorded `abortedAt` with `abortReason: event-disabled`, all native visitors reported idle, but Hunt remained `paused-event` with no return convoy. `anniversary/returns.ts` unconditionally waited for the old scheduled start even after abort. The fix exempts aborted rounds from the start/featured hold, while preserving both holds for active scheduled rounds. The seeded clock makes the failure repeatable; the same branch applies to user deselection during ordinary pre-start staging. This does not establish natural timed-expiry coverage.

## Native follower event-entry race

The Goobrawl restart scenario exposed a race that begins before the restart: the priest joined while the leader's last position was still Main, then launched ordinary following out of Goobrawl. The pre-restart snapshot already captured that outgoing native movement. The planner chose a Cyberland transit route, where movement stopped; event recovery later waited indefinitely for the priest's Main arrival. The client fix prevents following outside the current selected live event map and rechecks navigation ownership after an awaited join. Same-map following is retained. The planner transit issue is tracked separately; a safer route alone would still permit the incorrect early event departure.

## Native disabled-visitor return cleanup regression

The Hunt-off anniversary journey completed native return travel for both fighters, but its cycle never recorded completion. Deselected visitors were excluded from status-based anniversary observation, and the periodic tick skipped dispatched returns. The tick now reconciles dispatched cycles using the existing saved-route ownership checks, independently of whether attendees remain selected. Hunt stays off; no fresh attendance or old destination is manufactured. The failed native artifact records both completed movement receipts and the unreconciled cycle.

Native rare failures found during the full run: Hen and Golden Bat were selected
while Hunt farming used scatter mode. Rare acquisition captured grouped=false,
then switched to grouped mode; the next tick rejected the rare before formation
could acknowledge it. Preserve the ten-second selection admission window across
that mode handoff, without extending already-selected encounters or permitting
external claims. Hen must still receive native damage, die, produce its native
chest receipt, and resume the same Hunt.

Rejection ownership failure inventory: selecting a leader after startup must
write rejection evidence to that leader's profile; switching leaders must not
reuse another profile's rejection cache; persisted receipts must survive restart;
fresh actionable damage/reachability must still clear only the current profile's
receipt. The Hen red artifact has an immediate real rejection with no receipt in
E2EWarrior's profile, because the service captured the startup orphan dictionary.
The current native suite demonstrates initial leader selection, but does not yet
deterministically force rejection followed by a leader switch and restoration;
retain isolated retry-evidence coverage for that remaining gap.

Tinyp's native escapist mechanic is covered with an actual inventory fieldgen0,
automatic runtime deployment, native owned field entity, and item consumption.
The server's teleport/avoidance logic remains enabled; the test then requires the
same real damage, death, chest-open receipt, and Hunt continuation as other rares.

The native Tiny P deployment run exposed a separate inventory-contract bug:
rare carrier selection expected raw `{name}` items, while real heartbeats carry
`{slot,item}` entries. A real generator stayed in Warrior inventory and no
carrier was assigned; actual attacks triggered avoidance and magiport. See
`testing-tinyp-deployment-red.json`. Existing generator-carrier fixtures were
corrected to the real wire shape before implementation and failed with a missing
carrier. Production now uses the shared observed-inventory type and nested item
name. The native generator consumption/entity assertions remain unchanged.

Phoenix native failure inventory: follower membership changes must propagate the
joining character reset boundary into the destination group; previous-controller
queues must remain rejected, unrelated profiles must remain isolated, and an
existing owner Hunt must survive follower leave/rejoin. The native Phoenix red
(`testing-phoenix-reset-red.json`) had Priest epoch three milliseconds newer than
the group, permanently rejecting its target. Membership now advances the new
controller epoch and invalidates its stale group. The Phoenix journey exercises
real Follow off/on, observes native epoch convergence, then requires damage,
kill, loot and continued Hunt kills. The final native rare run passed.

Franky deselection now has a visible-boss combat regression: native damage and
an active target precede deselection, both clients must install the protected
exit convoy and reach Mainland while Franky remains alive. The prior admission
case exposed a real deadlock (testing-franky-exit-red.json): its afterCombat
wrapper waited for the boss to die before installing exit ownership. The
authorized Franky exit now clears targeting and installs its convoy immediately;
ordinary party-travel and Crab combat waits remain unchanged. The strengthened native Franky evacuation passed.

Removal gate: the interrupted 63-case run passed all four anniversary journeys
(cases 34–37), including disabled selection and Hunt-off return completion.
Removed the corresponding disabled-kiss and immediate completed-return cleanup
unit declarations. Retained newer-command ownership, failed restored convoy and
remaining timing negatives; rare removals were gated until the later clean seven-case native run.

The first explicit Follow-cycle rerun confirmed the production epoch fix: the
new controller and rejoining Priest shared epoch 1790624820153. The test initially
required the scatter-mode Warrior to acknowledge a group snapshot that does not
exist in scatter. It now checks the admission boundary before spawning, then
requires both native epochs to converge after actual rare damage restores grouped
combat. Damage, death, loot and same-Hunt continuation assertions are unchanged.

Cute Bee workflow difficulty: its native 99.9% avoidance produced repeated real
zero-damage miss packets despite correct group ownership. Combining that rate
with the five-second nominal DPS HP budget implies roughly 5,000 seconds of
combat. The workflow now seeds only that instance's native zone_stats avoidance
to zero, records original99.9 and seeded0, and uses native stat recalculation.
The global monster definition is restored synchronously; native hit, damage,
death and loot pipelines remain required. This does not cover normal Cute Bee
avoidance probabilities; retain any isolated avoidance policy negatives.

Final rare verification: all seven native rare cases passed, with 267 files
verified in `.build/rare-final-e2e-report` and the companion results archive.
Phoenix, Golden Bat, Cute Bee, Hen, Rooster and Tiny P each demonstrated native
damage, death, chest receipt, inventory loot and further kills in the same Hunt.
Tiny P additionally consumed and deployed its actual field generator; Phoenix
exercised real follower reset convergence. Disabled rare selection also passed.
Cute Bee uses the explicitly recorded per-instance avoidance-zero difficulty;
normal avoidance probabilities remain outside this workflow coverage.
Removed two whole rare-client declarations and trimmed duplicated success
fragments from two mixed controller cases. Retained priority switching, stale
reports/controls, retry persistence, failed/out-of-range generator deployment,
multiple-carrier selection and loot-failure negatives.
