# Runtime and tooling test audit

Historical first-pass audit. The follow-up [replacement matrix](testing-replacement-matrix.md)
supersedes the retention decisions and records subsequent removals.

Scope: 246 non-coordinator test files outside the dashboard audit filename set. This inventory records a representative retained failure scenario per file; it does not claim each scenario is exercised by the new browser suite.

Deleted 1 complete test file and 5 additional source/literal-only test cases (6 test registrations total); removed 6 source-regex assertions from 3 otherwise behavioral files. Retained 245 files, including 8 trimmed files. Counts refer to static test registrations, not parameterized runtime case totals.

The browser E2E suite cannot yet replace game movement/geometry, multi-character combat, inventory conservation, interrupted transfers, Steam ownership, updater/filesystem safety or malformed external packet coverage. These existing isolated tests remain exceptions because they catch specific bugs beyond the present E2E boundary. A small test is not automatically low signal; stale-owner and wrong-item checks can prevent substantial failures. Source extraction used to execute maintained functions is different from asserting their spelling. Future replacement should reproduce the listed failure through an integrated scenario before deleting it.

## Real game server boundary

The [upstream setup](https://github.com/kaansoral/adventureland_mongodb#quick-start) requires the game repository, common_engine, secretsandconfig, a MongoDB instance and map seeding, then separate backend and game-server processes. Account and character records are created separately. The console browser suite does not establish live game-server compatibility; pinning and provisioning that server plus disposable player data is future work.
