# Hunt lifecycle test audit

This ledger reviews **26 files / 156 source test declarations**. Parameterized declarations represent every branch in their source loop, not one runtime case. Event/anniversary/rare, travel-defense and merchant audits live in companion documents. Counts refer to the inventory before replacements, so removed rows remain traceable.

## Native scenarios

All L cases are in [live-hunt-lifecycle.spec.ts](../e2e/live-hunt-lifecycle.spec.ts). They use the pinned upstream game server, native clients, real coordinator HTTP and journal. Initial quests/equipment and the explicit death fault are declared fixtures; movement, kills, respawn, expiration and Daisy rewards are actual game execution. Every case attaches authoritative server/coordinator/native-event evidence; the suite reporter hashes the artifacts.

- **L1:** Boo Boo: native map doors, actual target combat, return and Daisy token.
- **L2:** A native quest expires, increments one failure, survives restart, reacquires a real Daisy quest without a completion token, then clears its blacklist.
- **L3:** Two independently completed party quests each produce exactly one token, including coordinator restart after Hunt exit.
- **L4:** A completed follower waits while its leader kills real goos; both subsequently claim rewards.
- **L5:** An unfollowed priest completes a solo Hunt while the warrior receives neither a quest nor a reward; independently addressed settings and saved/effective response metadata remain scoped.
- **L6:** Hunt off/restart/on creates a nonempty new cycle and continues killing toward the remaining native quest.
- **L7:** Choose a farther bee spawn rather than nearest, persist across restart, acquire that area and perform actual combat there.
- **L8:** Sixteen malformed/unauthorized mutations are rejected atomically without changing settings, backup, blacklist or cycle. Valid spawn patches preserve other monsters; blacklist add/remove/clear is exercised; the Hunt still earns its real reward.
- **L9:** Death threshold one: native death, exactly one recorded failure after restart, native respawn, blacklist removal and resumed quest progress.
- **L10:** Death threshold two: first native death/restart resumes the same cycle without recounting; a second native death crosses the threshold, persists two failures, then clearing its blacklist permits actual combat again.

- **L11:** A real kill changes W1/P8 into a completed leader plus unfinished follower. The leader earns its native reward without a loot-hold stall; the preserved follower quest completes either in the original party or through an explicitly recorded Follow-off/solo Hunt command.

These are coverage descriptions, **not a claim of passing validation**. Root runs the shared native stack and records final results in the testing guide. A successful journey does not replace an isolated test that injects a different race, stale observation or ownership conflict.

The 54-case diagnostic passed L1–L9 and L11, including L7's corrected merged farming-area fixture. L10 exposed a fixture fault: one ordinary lethal attack killed both stacked fighters, and Hunt correctly counted two deaths; see [the evidence](testing-single-death-red.json). The later `recovery11-diagnostic` run passed L10 with the corrected native Rime single-target death fixture, as well as all six consumers of that fixture. Earlier passing settings/death gates replaced four full source declarations, the enabled-blacklisting branch of one parameterized declaration, and the invalid-settings loop plus its zero-save assertion. L7 now also replaces the duplicate saved-count and successful restored-preference assertions; manual, excluded-area and cleared-preference fallbacks remain. Disabled blacklisting and other unique guards remain.

## Validation status

- `recovery11-diagnostic`: **10/11 passed**, with 380 artifact hashes verified. The uninterrupted Town return passed with 42.807 seconds of owned outward movement, zero extra recovery attempts and both native rewards. The restart variant earned both rewards but failed its no-extra-recovery assertion: shared preparation incorrectly timed out after 61.127 seconds because its clock included rendezvous travel.
- A separate preparation clock now prevents assembly travel from consuming the planner deadline. `return-clock-final` passed **3/3 cases**, with 163 artifact hashes verified: both Town variants and follower reconnect. Both Town cases earned the actual rewards without extra recovery attempts on this corrected source snapshot.
- `reconnect-final`: **1/1 passed**, with 100 artifact hashes verified, after fixing publication of route identity before awaiting native rendezvous.
- The verified native aggregate contains **63 unique cases whose latest outcomes passed**, across six preserved runs and their source snapshots. This is not a single full-suite run against one final snapshot.
- The last retained-unit run passed **3,166 tests**. This is the recorded retained-test run count, separate from the native evidence.

## Per-declaration disposition

The separate Town recovery scenarios use genuine partial Town casts near the
incident Bee region. The uninterrupted case covers the full 30-second outward
detour; the restart case begins after actual outward movement and preserves the
same Hunt/convoy. A native Town may legitimately become eligible after reconnect;
its coordinator transition, socket request and upstream completion timestamp are
recorded. Both cases reject false rendezvous timeouts and excess recovery attempts.

“Retain” means the named fault/combination is not demonstrated by the native scenarios above. “Partial” means the native journey covers part of a bundled case, so the unique guard stays. A replacement candidate is deleted only after its corresponding native case passes.

### continuous-hunt-return

L1 crosses native map doors and returns; it does not force three staggered runners through both Town-enabled and Town-disabled itineraries or cancellation.

| Source case (line at audit) | Disposition and remaining edge |
| --- | --- |
| [14](../scripts/tests/continuous-hunt-return.test.cjs#L14) — three managed runners return from '+map+' to Daisy on one itinerary; disableTown='+disableTown<br>Matrix: <code>const map of ['mansion','winterland']; const disableTown of [false,true]</code> | **Retain.** The named injected condition/combination has no equivalent native assertion in L1–L10; healthy travel or reward alone cannot establish this guard. |

### coordinator-hunt-composition

L1–L7 exercise healthy composition. Stale/offline roster reconciliation, replaced backup areas, pending loot and malformed persisted stages need targeted fault injection.

### coordinator-hunt-control

Normal turn-in and event exit do not exercise late acknowledgements, retry runtime compatibility, permission polling or duplicate departure requests.

### hunt-return-town

Native returns are covered, but these cases deliberately interrupt Town rounds, inject stale attack reports and drive rally/runtime timeout boundaries.

| Source case (line at audit) | Disposition and remaining edge |

That earlier uninterrupted run recorded 42,708 ms of owned outward movement; both cases passed without extra attempts, with 133 verified evidence files archived in `.build/town-final-e2e-report/` and `.build/town-final-e2e-results/`. The later recovery11 uninterrupted case also passed (42,807 ms, zero extra attempts), but its restart case caught a false preparation timeout despite both rewards. The subsequent `return-clock-final` rerun passed both Town variants and follower reconnect (3/3, 163 verified artifact hashes), certifying the separate-clock fix for these cases with both actual rewards and no extra Town recovery attempts. |

### hunt-route-acquisition

L1/L7 prove successful area acquisition. Wrong-phase early receipts, one stale/dead/foreign-instance member and persisted premature-farming repair remain distinct.

| Source case (line at audit) | Disposition and remaining edge |
| --- | --- |

| [67](../scripts/tests/hunt-route-acquisition.test.cjs#L67) — client does not send a Hunt handoff request or stop an installed route | **Removed — native fighter-death journey passed.** This called a no-op function with throwing stubs. Native outbound armadillo travel, actual kills and Daisy reward catch an unwanted movement stop; asserting that this particular helper never calls HTTP added no distinct workflow protection. |

### hunt-route-recovery

No lifecycle journey exhausts both planners or changes geometry/ownership during route-recovery budget selection.

### hunt-safety

Healthy Hunt/reward/death workflows overlap this file. The table identifies partial overlap; cancellation, stale identity and multi-batch guard combinations remain retained.

| [71](../scripts/tests/hunt-safety.test.cjs#L71) — persisted death observations prevent recounting an old death after restart | **Removed — native threshold-two death/restart passed.** The native character dies, failure count stays one through actual coordinator journal reload, respawn and subsequent real Goo kills. That catches recounting the same persisted death while the same quest remains active. |
| [75](../scripts/tests/hunt-safety.test.cjs#L75) — manual navigation cancellation while awaiting respawn prevents fallback from reviving movement | **Retain.** The named injected condition/combination has no equivalent native assertion in L1–L10; healthy travel or reward alone cannot establish this guard. |

| [238](../scripts/tests/hunt-safety.test.cjs#L238) — blacklisted leader quest selects a follower and keeps its owner through combat and turn-in | **Removed — native fighter-death E2E passed.** The real leader dies during a Goo Hunt; native respawn completes, eligible follower becomes armadillo quest owner, kills both targets and receives the actual Daisy reward. This replaces the isolated selected-follower combat/turn-in progression. |

### hunt-selector

Console Hunt E2E clicks real controls; it does not render all ended/blacklisted/batch/stale-member status variants asserted here.

### hunt-settings

L2/L8 cover expiration and an invalid mutation. Threshold migration, disabled counters, atomic mixed-field updates and stale expiry reports remain distinct.

| Source case (line at audit) | Disposition and remaining edge |
| --- | --- |
| [8](../scripts/tests/hunt-settings.test.cjs#L8) — defaults, historical migration, accumulated thresholds and restart persistence | **Retain.** The named injected condition/combination has no equivalent native assertion in L1–L10; healthy travel or reward alone cannot establish this guard. |
| [17](../scripts/tests/hunt-settings.test.cjs#L17) — settings endpoint validates atomically, preserves disabled counts, evaluates changes and cancels pending conflict | **Trimmed — L8 passed.** Removed four invalid-shape iterations and the zero-save assertion. Retained disabled-count accumulation, threshold reevaluation and pending competition cancellation. |
| [30](../scripts/tests/hunt-settings.test.cjs#L30) — expiry counts attempted unfinished quests once, survives restart and ignores completed and stale reports | **Partial: L2.** Real native expiry counts once and survives restart. Retain stale status and completed-quest exclusion, not forced by L2. |

### hunt-spawn-preferences

L7 now selects a farther bee spawn, persists it and observes actual combat there. Manual/unavailable preference fallback and preserving other monster patches remain distinct.

| Source case (line at audit) | Disposition and remaining edge |
| --- | --- |
| [11](../scripts/tests/hunt-spawn-preferences.test.cjs#L11) — Hunt preference survives settings save and restart; manual and unavailable routes use normal ranking | **Trimmed — L7 passed in remaining54.** Removed save-count and restored preferred-area assertions after native farther-spawn persistence, arrival and actual kills passed. Retained manual selection, unavailable preference and preference clearing assertions; renamed the remaining case accordingly. |
| [25](../scripts/tests/hunt-spawn-preferences.test.cjs#L25) — spawn patches retain other monsters and reject invalid selections atomically | **Removed — L8 passed.** Native API rejects every original invalid spawn shape and unknown key, preserves another monster preference during valid patching, and the active Hunt earns a real reward. |

### hunt-spawn-settings-ui

The console settings journey does not open the spawn radio popup or exercise a failed save.

| Source case (line at audit) | Disposition and remaining edge |

### monster-hunt-start

L8 covers invalid backup followed by successful real Hunt completion. Missing Daisy/backup setup and idempotent active reselection remain distinct.

| Source case (line at audit) | Disposition and remaining edge |

| [19](../scripts/tests/monster-hunt-start.test.cjs#L19) — valid backup is saved with monster selection before Hunt starts; invalid backup makes no changes | **Removed — L8 and console Hunt passed.** Invalid backup is rejected without changing the nonempty current cycle and native reward completes. The console Hunt journey verifies saving the valid backup/focus and retaining it after mode exit. |

### monster-spawn-ui

Native catalog acceptance is covered in live-catalog.spec.ts, but old version-2 upgrade negotiation and the browser loading/restricted-spawn display are not injected there.

| Source case (line at audit) | Disposition and remaining edge |

### solo-hunt-ui

L5 starts solo through the real API; it does not verify inherited read-only controls or saved-vs-effective UI state.

| Source case (line at audit) | Disposition and remaining edge |
| --- | --- |

### solo-hunt

L5 proves an unfollowed priest can claim a native reward without activating the warrior. Concurrent controllers, ownership migration and Follow toggles remain distinct.

| Source case (line at audit) | Disposition and remaining edge |
| --- | --- |
| [38](../scripts/tests/solo-hunt.test.cjs#L38) — legacy leader migrates once; personal defaults and blacklists remain independent after restart | **Partial: L5.** Separate profiles are exercised. Legacy profile migration and independent persisted blacklist settings are not. |

| [117](../scripts/tests/solo-hunt.test.cjs#L117) — HTTP controls reject inherited edits, address solo settings, and report saved/effective mode | **Removed — L5/L8 passed.** Real scoped HTTP rejects follower/merchant/unknown edits, returns solo saved/effective metadata, and keeps solo/leader settings independent while the solo character completes a real Hunt. |
| [136](../scripts/tests/solo-hunt.test.cjs#L136) — all-blacklisted fallback contains only the singleton | **Retain.** The named injected condition/combination has no equivalent native assertion in L1–L10; healthy travel or reward alone cannot establish this guard. |
